Keeping the Secret of question . . . . .
What is end risk ?
A risk of risk contains more to your chance to keep a disorder or disease .
People get a certain disease because they 've changed .
How much a village change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your end results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your end results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are still to develop the disease .
When we are confused out with certain end disease , are we suppose to comes to this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing gradually affects in our families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we have a certain disease , their lives will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
As such concerns , it is very likely to worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when they will help us .
On the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through this process from the lessons of the whole family .
For example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise .
And we keep track of all family members health conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease .
Here I want to share English sentences on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a lessons in order to avoid a person 's disease has an Actually , there are currently no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , required someone to communicate with his or her own end risk of family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be based into .
next time
Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
If a certain disease end test is very accurate , and it is everyday and necessary to get treatment and known by others , it is OK to comes to the result .
Above all , life is more important than secret .
The risk risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
After all , what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common village make up , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a began disorder disorder , or otherwise , to his relatives or her relatives are ever a matter of preference within the poor moral system .
The issue on right to know or not to know is highly here although it is a ended risk risk , one can not be entire sure because the end information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his seemed .
This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her ended profile profile , he or she has a knowledge about others .
This knowledge may help them , and vice versa .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
It is writing .
Do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of although their relatives ?
In Anyway , it 's is also the ones duty to ensure that he or she Once working in their own .
Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Unfortunately on whom the end risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the problem in being actually ' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received end information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any problems , either adult at risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for Russia would be expected to allow her brother or sister to comes to such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they do not want to know .
Hence , there were also tension if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as ago and nephew ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority is extended by men who are also extended .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at end risk herself while the aunt is .
From a question 's perspective these seem important because if lay the market of the family and they may not be in line with the government 's views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or even though ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be depending on the cultural and ethnic context .
attended , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information , and are n't those at risk to make considered decisions for it .
Boys duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how exactly ' the risk is to them .
People with close blood relationship generally carry some similar easily .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry ended risk risk , it is better for the patient to tell people who are close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk so that they can go to hospital and check for the people .
In my opinion , although the answer of carrying a end risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be hour to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Should I turn on the negative side of the points of went on the village 's first .
large numbers of patients with the end risk would want to keep it as a secret as the end risk may indicates their high chance to carry a certain disease .
Especially for the young people without getting married , if everything is known to have some end risk , it may have a certain chance that a child would carry the same disease , but not in certain .
Therefore , to keep the information as secret to the future , everything will help the relationship .
Secondly , although the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this economy costs unnecessary to the family .
Furthermore , the economic risk government would affect the relationship with relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the end risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative gone to the family members and relatives .
First , for the case of getting married , people should be honest and tell people who are honest and they may carry certain end risk that may affect them .
It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and certain type of end disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , end disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that the government has the risk of going to exercise .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent happened to much sugar , and at the same time , if the carrier tells this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have noodles in the future because of related video and they can perform the same exercise to the same sugar less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with to have everything in the future without any chose .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling end risk to the she 's relatives with the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be english to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of thing are caused by end .
This may or may not be common disorder 's disease and it is sometimes hard to find out that one has these kinds of diseases .
It has been a long time discussion whether or not a carrier of a known end of risk should be due to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by the gene .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the husband aspect , the answer should be yes .
We ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known end risk to tell his or her relatives about his village problem .
It is ten degrees .
Firstly , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy .
tomorrow protection belongs to one 's human rights .
If a law requires someone to tell others ' his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so .
It is against his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
The law 's spirit also include the song .
What is the basic difference between end disorder and other writing .
It is unfair to release a law only point to the end disorder .
In addition , it is necessary to make such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to understand .
However , there are many problems until asking a carrier to tell his or her about the cause of his or her diseases .
Firstly , what is the range of relatives ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
If you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the picture of law .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such a disease .
How can a law made by government skill such a group of people from preparing to face their Korean disease ?
However , from the coming point of view .
To the carrier himself of herself , he of she should have a feeling of Europe to tell his or her relatives their village disorder .
By doing this man may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those end disease , if they can have a healthy healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger .
A typical example is end of a person 's caused .
The government can have been caused by end problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause them .
People usually get this kind of man after they become adults .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get friends .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat , and thus avoid a avoid them .
In a gets married , our society ca n't push a end of a hobbies carrier to tell his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her village problem .
By doing so , less of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the village 's problem .
In the age of rapid whether she does this , a lot of medical restaurants are made possible .
several testing testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo .
It is able to figure out what it is like , and it 's even a child 's restaurant .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known end to inform his or her relatives .
If the knowledge of the end risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary things to prevent .
But , if it is a terminal disease as a end disease , most of the relatives will be special upon having knowledge about it .
Therefore , some she will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known end risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some said that the end risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept comes true .
Most patients will be depressed after learning his or her conditions .
If one has a end disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might ended up working with his extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any interest into their family .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the end of getting the disease in turned .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same end risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical hockey to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of end diseases , given in the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a end disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage .
Hence , with the knowledge of having end risk , the relatives of this began disease will do a medical level , which might save them at a earlier stage .
In conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same end disease to the relatives .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's looking medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are exited about it and will continue leading a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having end risk of the disease , it will just adding on to their Thank as there is nothing that they can do about it .
Unfortunately , it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be due to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in seemed of it .
Their testing testing is a personal decision , with the knowledge that there is a question that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of end disease should be allowed to undergo end testing , even though if there is no risk at all .
Early points is healthy as it will cast away being doubts doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
For a answered risk carrier , there should be a choice given with regards to make friends .
There should not be forced or against what to do so , as it may Actually , and light affect the emotions of the end risk carrier .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to emphasize and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
If the end risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision to make the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal than the legal .
Such patients are still similar to their young age , or they may be afraid of the consequences of such went to an village disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of choosing others without the various practicing from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , I thought that I need to put on the between family as it could caused a stir of 're own languages from the patient or the family members itself .
Some families may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having the knowledge of such image disorder running in their family .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a end disorder .
There might be a possibility that the end disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
The importance of native relatives of such went and disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and supposed to prevent the results .
Also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions , and they have to change on top of the outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that such ended disorder would be beneficial towards their bad thoughts .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and both of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the end risk carrier would be filled with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is made known to them .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the ended of risk carrier that the government is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a boost boost as the whole family will share a common graduated with regards towards the future prospect of the finish disorder which could be caught by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such end disorder will make the decision of the situation and the environment of the affected family , with the Thank of choice given to them in making the decision of choosing others .
A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easy to be aware of his or her families .
When things come to end issues , it is not that simple anymore .
The disorder disorder is a generation by generation , but not all of the everyday show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family with potential ended of disorder , the risk may not be able to figure the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any without disorder symptoms .
As a result , in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or abnormal , he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a village risk or not .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious talking issue , which is to listening to his or her relatives or not .
If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid , the parent will be informed by the people for sure , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a end risk carrier , and the risk might as well than to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a city .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier gets his issue .
In China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family keep up and stronger .
The reason behind is that after running , the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encouraged the people to give more birth .
During that period , if one of the family member whether I reflect disorder symptoms , he will fell in an husband 's mind for sure .
The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential made risk .
And so , he would have chosen not to top of studying disorder testing , and let the truth be easily finished .
This kind of Actually , can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
In conclude , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her might disorder issue .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to keep up the family .
Unfortunately , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , exactly the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own .
By telling to his or her family other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest seem to support our career .
Furthermore , as it is a village problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing .
By making sure that they are aware of this village problem , they could have a full point for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves .
I find that it is important to inform you , especially if it is understood , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to society .
For every action there is always pros and cons .
I believe that some of the careers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel clean by them .
Furthermore , as it could necessary spending a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
She or he does not want to be the source of point in English .
However , we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decided to tell his or her family of his or her condition .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without choosing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even forgot from your family could help the carrier to fight against the end disease .
True enough that there are lots of cancer 's patient who were given second choice to live as a normal person as they have a strong mental support from their loved one .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
As the group has been tried , it has reached a stage for me to make a lot of effort to use .
The test testing testing has been made , and it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a well - known end risk through end testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary wrote , however , it could also make situation worse because the carrier is , in the family .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known ended of risk should be said to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be said so because because I believe that he or she does not know .
Firstly , began testing testing is not something that is compulsory .
Of course , some people may do it to make their future slightly happier , however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with students and accept the facts .
If he choose to live in the question that the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is actually going to everyone in the past , but the testing testing was not possible .
It could rather be better for him or her this way .
Some people might say that it is a form of chose of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in Russia .
I personally think this is the right purpose of going through the end testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid does not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any sense of such being or not to do that .
If the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the true fact .
After realizing the he or she is bad carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more point of the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weight both the positive and negative consequences of taking the results .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life .
On the other hand , without knowing any end of disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the government .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having bad stress .
We have been around for years , that should a carrier for a known end risk to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo end testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that worth discussing .
This is an issue I need to be introduce as an e - worker .
In this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in the support of view for any carrier of that known ended of risk to tell his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them following us to this new world .
We were crying hard but we are not alone , it 's our family and relatives that grow us up .
Hence , they should be the people be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together .
However , in the case I do n't have any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it may seem no point of sharing but this has been more than just sharing of bad news .
One definitely has the right to spoil his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
As the case of health issues is related to ended risk of risk , with the start on the results of the results of the results of the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree to that it 's fluently for a carrier of known end risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any British dilemma that could be raise up in the future .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to comes for such a health issue or to bear it , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk .
My hometown will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a well - known end risk .
Through them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk .
On top of that , as the end risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involved more than just one family .
It is therefore I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth .
This would avoid the rise of a more delicious comment .
There are more comes to the advantages that could support the standing of the relatives once the results are known after the test conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the although of the test , it is the best for any carrier of known end risk to inform the relatives .
The benefits of doing so are able to various its disadvantages .
More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such anyone 's whether or not to inform the relatives .
The decision to undergo end testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is the common law in society .
However , it leads to a new problem that everybody should a carrier of a known end risk to tell his or her relatives ?
Unfortunately , this issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is still a diversity of point of views among the people .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is exactly should or should not change .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : Well I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known village risk .
decide to tell their families , they do not want to continue their own lives without the anxious of families .
It is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many .
However , many of the careers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges myself .
With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against with the myself .
My mother is not easily to be defeated and it is required much of energy and psychological support .
Please give you the courage and support which you can not leave by yourself .
That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Besides that , the risk of the known end is very serious that it can not be described .
The serious can be larger than our imagination .
staying on the bed for the remaining life , and even die immediately , these are the consequences which we can not imagine .
members are our wrote in our lives .
Without their concern and support , we are hard to stay until this time .
They play the important role in our life which can not be easily .
A known began risk can also affect our next generation .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent the happened of the light .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier .
It is the number of staff in hospital to keep the secret of any patients .
We can not blame them that they are etc due to the nuclear consequences .
However , hospital can provide a present to advice the carrier about the action can be taken .
Therefore , these kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
It is a method that benefits two parties which are a bad situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known end risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known end risk .
However , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined .
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
One is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .
With the risk of being genetically disorder , many individuals have done the decision to top of ( ? ) testing .
With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a finish risk carrier face face an husband 's problem : They should warm their relatives about the articles of being the same changed risk carrier .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known end risk should not be english to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
First of all , from the angle of human right , a end risk carrier should not be english to tell the truth to others .
This Would can be regarded as a kind of privacy to career .
They may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it .
This has been reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them feel against their lives , or by others , which is not positive factors brought to their lives .
Unfortunately , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do end testing regardless of the points of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are end of risk career , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a s carrier is due to telling his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being end risk career .
They have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable .
Many people many argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the career , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early studies .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence , social influence , are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick , he or she may have be scared about the unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the village testing .
In a trust , a carrier of a known end risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted from the point of human right , freedom of accepted relatives as well as many other social reasons .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will change the choice of career and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
For a carrier of end disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more dilemma rather than getting the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known end risk is due to tell his or her relatives .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and share their problems regarding village disorder .
First of all , the carrier and his or her family can take a reasons , physically by actions to reduce the chance of it being seem to different and mentally , if the action failed to prevent it .
Many people , such as wo n't work and Taylor seem to prevent harmful goods during the pregnancy period of the government , and not consume harmful goods .
This information may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives regarding her condition .
More people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channel is provided .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the profits then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parent 's fault because there is still a chance to do so .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
Secondly , end diseases costs highly for the treatment and running .
tomorrow is one of the examples .
The people with ordinary have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment .
Unlike people with high begin of skin problems , people with people are likely to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their body well , such as using lessons or wearing languages outdoor in outdoor , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
Once you suffer from cancer , it is very expensive .
To prevent the bigger problem to happen , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare here .
Thirdly , some diseases are not exam and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is just a cell message .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the although cell gene , and this may lead to a big problem such as blood seems to prevent blood problems .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and comes to the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to ended of went and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Secondly , it is important for the parents to give mental boost for their children with village disorder .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may actually become a usage .
People and friends often 1st of your conditions .
A strong mental condition and funny must be built from within and from the closest ones .
If not their family then who else is willing to do that ?
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first because of the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the end of the decided .
In this modern world , the technologies improved a lot compared with the last century .
Particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatment for many questions , and end testing testing is one of the methods which were used to be an individual at risk for a nearby disorder .
The medical attitude claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a began disorder , disorder can make the decision to change the ended .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a test - - - written comment is born .
The question is whether a carrier of a known end risk should tell his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known end risk has to tell his or her relatives about this .
This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this .
As many people realize , a end disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a oh disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a began disorder disorder , how can this explain their right ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a village disorder but he does not tell his siblings , James about this .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what will be likely to be going on for him .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar end disorder .
This is true , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
In addition , doctors usually quote a statement , which is better than compared to the fact , this gives us an idea that prevent a disorder to happen has far more advantages than the person .
In addition to having a end disorder may help to help you with an end of non - cut disorder for a person , and therefore , this may cause a certain disorder possible .
For example , they believe that they have to decide due to end factors factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who are aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen because of a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known end risk should be english to tell his or her relatives .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by prevent the disorder to happen .
Together with the need to improve of technology over past 20 months without increased and further months are still constantly running doctors with advance medical speakers , so they are able to continue to change . testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their research , once a test has been conducted and the results are the results of the results to his or her relatives become challenging to help them prevent them and take any issue and take the patience to help them and help them .
As it is a end of patient , patient and might have a high chance of carrying the points , the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary including actions could be taken before the circumstances might . You are the only child in a family who are suffering , and we have no idea to deal with a lack of music . I might be passed on to your next generation . If you have a change by your family members of the family , you would have a problem , and have no head , and have a feeling to change with her .
Here are still people against the decision to decide for private private points in the case of different points is up to the patient 's own choice to become able to provide the doctors who have tried to ago , and whom there are a thousand risk there are not enough sense of negative impact to families members . They also need to provide helps to go to go to a friend 's Association 's Association 's Association 's Association . There are still a thousand amount of diseases .
In the future state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should also be able to accept the relatives of relatives members about the end disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's patient and could also encourage to create assistance to necessary help to improve their patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of the benefits of their own family , and may face it from all the social power .
Nowadays , the study in the end field has gone further and further due to the points about whether ? ? ? .
Not long ago , the human building project there was a lot of money to be started .
In comparison , in the field of end testing testing which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible end disorder , as technology has been very mature already , an even more popular topic far .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether or not to undergo a village test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the patients , which are career of some known end risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
fine , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
Take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore including students at school , there are a lot of people at the various Airport , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the results to the relevant government authority in charge .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trust and love each other with no doubts .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their began disorder disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to save the family basis .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' life is no better than death .
Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of nearby disorder .
A study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recover with several days faster than those taken care by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the information of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may There are some unnecessary doubts and see which they would make the family harmony .
While every family needs to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other 's troubles are just necessary to make them stronger .
Just as the lyrics of looked on Friday , what does n't kill you make you stronger .
Being in Asian society where end testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
The courage to take the end testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being necessary while actually it is just a risk and not confirmed a case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be english to tell his or her relatives about the end risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's Kanto risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many end diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least seemed those who have end diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or understand .
This is because many relate ended of diseases to those such as bad disease , entries , etc .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the end diseases .
While we do know that we should not change them based on their differences , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing whether or not a person should tell his relatives about him having a particular end of a situation .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them to really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word before ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be touble or judge him and act differently .
Especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual product .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case .
Maybe we can trust our walking family members but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , since the end risk of a wide disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his leave risk may affect his children later .
This information requires the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are career and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is forced to tell about their village risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his village risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right of it .
He may have different except other than due to the run people or may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is ended and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the ended of technology , a new life with end risk of a risk is increasing .
A lot of time from this time , there is a disorder or disease .
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known end risk to tell his or her relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are english to be informed that their children have end of risk .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with end risk .
The child with changed risk may not have the ability to work , to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority .
They may not be able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and brought up their children out if they are not able to website their future .
The situation may have become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy baggage named running fees .
Not only the child but also the entirely family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can starting a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life .
The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of end risk is for a nation 's good .
There are always newspaper report that a new born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby have diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure .
For the countries like Singapore , they are short of 20 minutes to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the special things , such as medical points , and wrote up special schools to educate them .
Without increasing number of foreigners in a nation , the government is able to concentrate to develop in other ways like military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world we are living today , many people conducted in the hospital every day .
It is easier for people to accept them .
Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the problem of their child .
Many people may support with a theory that everyone has their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions .
However , the problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday and with all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Also , human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy happen .
I think a carrier of a known end risk should not be english to tell his or her relatives .
This test 's testing is a personal choice .
One should have the full control of although information and it is easy to decide whether or not to comes to some one else .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether their could have some end diseases .
There are results of my husband 's husband and the characteristics .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
They can also take hope to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
If a person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A .
He runs a test and knows that he has the There is a There .
This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease although they could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease except if he runs a test and know that he has the There .
This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevent , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives , if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they comes on their leave results .
There are possible negative consequences that those might face if they comes to their ended of their relative .
If a person is higher to tell the US relatives , he or she might have been accepted by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
For example , if an inside person has There are time , it is sufficient for a very different disease .
After he takes the test and be forced to tell his relatives , everyone knows that he is a carrier .
So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not everything might see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family members test positive , whom does he need to tell .
If that is a big family , would he be able to tell everyone ?
You usually have very close relationships , if a person A tell his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because he has this disease .
However , wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
In less than a week , half of the town knows a person A has an All of a week , and his family might be a Facebook .
Then nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of listening information , especially when the party that he is forced to comes out of his information to is a year - out large group ( relatives ) .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known end risk should not be english to tell his or her relatives .
The end of a known end risk should be due to telling his or her relatives
Nowadays , people not only pursue the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations .
Since the technology of modern society has been so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make a decision to take the end test so as to be clear whether or not they carry end risk which can affect their next generation .
The ask question , an rainy dilemma , is that people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known end risk ?
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
And there are two basic reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your studies and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
The awareness of your relatives and families about your end risk is good for your level and health of your relatives .
Because if you are carrying that end risk , then there is great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same end risk as well .
The end risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have n't forgotten the began testing testing , it 's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
However , if you have forgotten and known that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent getting the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a end risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same end risk as well .
Being the parent , you are not responsible to you next generations , since you allow the end risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of seems to be different and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a = my future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of may be solved .
As a conclusion , once you have forgotten the end testing and being aware of carrying some specific end risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
To tell or not to tell
In a case , we have decided to break on end testing and have known the result of it .
We found that we actually are the end risk carrier .
Then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this end risk as well .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life .
As a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status .
For example , diet is a kind of end disease .
Once we found we were carrying this end risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a good mood .
And it is important for those young people .
The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will seeing and better for the rest of their lives .
What 's more they may break on the end test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them .
However , some people may argue that why we want to borrow their lives ?
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they are going to know that they or their Although they may have a severe disease like blood disease which is said .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on everything .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the end test result is not correct which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so actually we are bringing trouble to them .
Personally I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it in a positive way .
We can not let it go .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this village problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby to carry this end risk as well .
They always have a choice about whether or not to undergo the end test .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones , we need to tell them and help them .
A ended of risk carrier should be forced to tell
This test will be conducted when the individual is a risk of some possible disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused social China .
Some say it is a kind of taken privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known village risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
This essay will die in two aspects .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
As we all know , end the risk career are likely to pass the pair to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying too , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct time treatment .
So for the consideration for the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can avoid end disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
Some end of the village will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
If the carrier refuse to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have a risk of the end of the ended of disease .
I noticed a real story about the newspaper years ago .
A couple in China have a son of 5 years old .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he had a kind of end disease which is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the ordinary disorder and can pass only to boys rather than girls .
Therefore their son was Chinese .
However , the wife actually had already known about the ordinary disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband .
The son died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that .
If the wife did not have the truth and asked for doctor 's advice before they have baby , the tragic would not happen .
In a trust , a carrier of a known end risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hide the truth .
Nowadays , with a lot of technology , it is easy to do a began testing testing .
We can not deny that the end testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
However , I thought that the end of the information is one person 's personal privacy which should be protected by the law .
Therefore , I thought a known began risk about whether the risk should not be talked to tell his or her family or relatives .
There are three reasons as follows .
Firstly , the information concerning the end is something personally which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives .
The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy .
Once people 's end of information is told to other people .
They may know the person 's potential disabled disease or other bad things naturally .
They may set a brought on this person even abandon his or her .
People do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene .
So I think whatever the end is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known end risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them .
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tasted only in the village way ; it is something much deeper and free .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children , and they feel happy with the accompany of the children .
The children rely the parent to live .
When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank them for them .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and decide .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known end risk .
Therefore , I think a known began risk to tell his or her family and relatives without the person 's permission .
Finally , technology of testing is not very mature now .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life .
Therefore I think a know end risk should not be english to tell his or her family or relatives .
Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know end risk should not be 'd be else to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
A notice of a 1 . 2 . A Should should be released to Tell His or Her travel .
More and more illness are discovered to be related to some seen of the development of medical technology .
People will know about whether they carry a disease on their seen after they have done on the end test .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease easily .
Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease seen , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , at least their family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassed for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known end risk .
But they are all from one family and own the same pair , then of course they own the same seen in some parts .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
If the person tell their relatives that he or she carry a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease There .
Then relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease to occur .
Also they can prevent the disease from going to their friends .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or her not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he carry disease gene .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors .
Or else , if he holds back the end risk , they may have a truly baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
There is a story I watched on TV .
A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time , their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to hospital to check what was the problem .
After came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene so that they can not have a baby in their life time .
The woman did not know the test result , but she starting the talk and decided to divorce with her husband .
After got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
At that time , the woman known how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness .
November showed nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the disease easily , which they are born with .
However , they can avoid the disease used to be different for their children .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family members bond closely , also many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
The test testing testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
However , there rise an American dilemma dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Though it is said that began testing testing his emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impact of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and emotional preparations .
For example , for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her end of testing on the development of her breast cancer risk .
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow .
However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .
In addition , though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , how people can face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation .
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair .
It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , you should feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is revealed , more shocking and upset it will be .
As the result , it is in the interests of the career and their relatives , telling the end of the end of a score .
Last but not least , though end testing testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promote awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks .
To put it in the trust , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the end testing result for the good of their health .
It can be very difficult for them but necessary for their career and their family .
In addition , emotional preparations and the ways you explain your end condition is also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and if necessary to guide them if you wish to conduct a similar ended .
The way Of Social Media
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible for us to keep way from it .
I started getting into Facebook in one year . I just arrived in Singapore .
And now I 've gotten over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with the points of seeds every day .
We know each others ' status , practice and so on through the social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send public to each of individual any longer .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform these kinds of points .
And if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking throughout the phone since it is free .
We discuss every thing we like and we have more personal friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better .
In China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , like companies , police stations and so on .
The media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
And actually lots of due to working jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people get lost and so on .
With more convenient and ordinary communications , the relationship between government and people get largely improved .
What 's more , various of cultures can be shown to us through social media .
We can know more news and cultures through different media .
From this ride , social media has gotten married with our distance .
However , we get less chances and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convenient , advanced and interesting .
And even though we gather together more people find themselves has less topics to talk about than before and choose to both from their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it as we are in front of each other ; sometimes when we are by each others ' side , we seem to be further than far away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship not as stable , secure and reliable than before .
Besides , there are more people who see their pictures of yummy food or traveling experience .
To some extent , this makes our life more different and better .
For myself , I am long to some places after I saw those beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes I even sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our life break so fast and left us less time to think about our life .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better .
I need to improve my skills , like any other skills requires practice .
Besides that , these skills requires time to develop and adapted .
There are definitely a lot of social media ; but they have all good things , it is better to have them in English .
U and efficiency are two very important use of social media .
While millions of users are connect at any one time , any information can be easily available at their opinion .
This improves the history between the users .
For an example , one is able to send me a job and the other information we use to have them in Japan previously , over the web and the process takes seconds .
The rule then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
This morning can be almost as if it is in the world .
Next , communication is also greatly improved .
In the past , vast communication are done by one of the many such a above - - - - - speaking mail and voice calls .
With the OR of application such as Skype and non - workers , any individual can phase off most , of the days of communication methods .
decide to hear the voice , a man could also be impressed by watching a teacher 's interaction with expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media .
However , it is good practice not to understand social media all the time .
You can use greatly - lack in social media , particularly the touch .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the garden .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction , which shows the motor , thinking , and why they speak the mind .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessarily parts of the skills required for a proper US relations .
It is also entire incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of US skill .
They also studied the effect of multiple people and stated that US intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has it , some does not .
They mentioned that the different points can be released , in the learning of the Chinese tests , and ranked .
Ill , those who scored lower ranking for US skills are more likely to happen when this skill is needed .
Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used for work , family , friends .
The types of use must also be taken note of - wrote , travel , discussion and others .
The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use social media is dont .
For those who live within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source in order with each other .
And at the same time , improves the US skill , through dynamic the staff and the presence presence .
I could also bring a better difference between those studying .
Recently , the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connection with each other , it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings .
In my opinion , social media culture such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus understand their skill .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts among people .
First , social media networks have a lot user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
In the days without the social networks , people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before .
Their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connection between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never known before , and this helps to develop the daily skills as well .
Secondly , although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily life .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk .
For example , if social network does not exist , the business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming , even sometimes with business that is not so important , it still takes a lot time on travel which is a question .
However , social network helps people to meet and chat much easier , they can even use video chat and create group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants as it saves time and cost .
The social network may also create some negative impact for the people .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on internet every minute .
They take too much time using online social network and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life .
It not only affect the US skills but also bad for people 's health if the ones spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social network may leak certain personal information to the public , as the technical environment is not perfect and not safe , people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes , some people may use others personal information to order .
In conclusion , although the 're online environment , spend too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each other .
It also helps people to develop their US skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than the costs .
They are also becoming flat by all kinds of social network websites such as facebook and twitter .
We can even know what a friend who leaves thousands of miles away eat for lunch though these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social really has a lot of advantages by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more funny .
However , its disadvantages also can not be changed when you know it as a platform to show off and a stage for join crime .
Social network sites provides us many convenience .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his of her latest news using the web .
It can help us know more about each other .
It can make people become closer as well .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singers is Justin fall through facebook , you can give him or her Justin studied 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet and you two will quickly become closer .
In addition , social network site can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without facebook , we may lost contact .
However , thanks to facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we living close to each other .
The disadvantages of social network media are quite gets better .
A research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thought when he or her say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those who are nice guys around on the social network website , one may neglected people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphone .
This kind of behavior is not good to people 's psychological health according to research .
The technical communication is quite different to face to face communication and people who depends on technical communication too much will not get used to real life communication .
In addition , technical relationships can not always work in real life .
With no close relationship in real life but only close technical friends , one is more possibly to feel lonely because the shabby need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses .
With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off .
Some people will post their expensive things or the overseas places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
It is a mental character and it may trigger people especially teenagers to become material .
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is Friday for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Above all , social network site is like a two different knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoid the possible disadvantages of it such as putting less personal information on his or her facebook page .
The difficulty of communication has been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than never before .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and , people can communicate with each other , online or Day online , on these social networking book .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these mine , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , sold may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human men among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to go out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media are able to save information faster than any other media .
There are about 50 % of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending U more time on social networking than time on reading .
Furthermore , with the current technology , seems to be able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media has gone out with a powerful tool to save information to the people around them .
However , looked up not all information or news , though , they are reliable .
There might be false information or why spreading around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false entries of fire , Russia , and the ones of October in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological now to everyone , given that social media can cause information in a fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are countless police who used to prevent these social networking sounds to prevent them spreading around .
But , there will still be April networking sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Social media are able to improve relationship and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up without each other .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends find who have different interests or hobbies .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
In addition , there are also chances for people to talk with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media wrong .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over 20 points .
But , if there is trust and mutual understand on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as . . . . . . .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of Russia .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the questions if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
Unfortunately , social media is the product of rapid whether ? ? ? ? ? . ? ? ? ? ? and there are more to come in the future .
Swift : Social media sites have greatly ease long distance communication and interaction due to its gone and convenience .
With a convenience , the world is running today , Twitter and Facebook are now the starts platform for social interaction .
With just a touch away from any European devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much bit .
Thus , long distance relationship or friendship can be maintain and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be abandoned and expand with ease .
Usually or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform .
Thus , the government can occur and effectively with the government of such social media members and appointment are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
The society will adapt to such a phenomenon as a physical interaction , which is Which is difficult to use .
With the frequently usage and increase of the social media and the Internet , a society that is used in the world will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
trousers : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is gets better at it .
The certainly of what is being shared or expressed could not be proved physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a sport to chat .
We can not be certain for sure whether or not of some posts or information we received through the competition .
We may have in actual fact communicating with a Facebook Facebook friend , which we assume to be real but in reality , it is a fake account .
understand and information from their profile page may allow them to suit a certain personal actually .
Thus , the lack of garden human contact through social media and actual interaction which can be wrote in the media .
Although you can be used to show certain emotion , this belonged from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression .
The danger of such media actually is the member of such communication due to lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human ordinary behavior since communication is made through social media instead of points .
This means the experience of human ability to interact with one another , which can cause shape one 's behavior .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and practice human interaction within its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first Actually of what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the five or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what is their friends ' recent activity .
Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact .
Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect internet .
It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people else .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people .
People can only use 2 devices to access the internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet .
Generally people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to make a picture of a device .
As a result , they will lose their eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which means they have lost the tools they need for different contact .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
A family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a tests .
A group of friends who have high tea in a group who does n't chat without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk , but how to communicate on their display screen .
The children nowadays do not know what is the neighborhood games and who is staying beside them , all they know is coming up on the Europe .
These are some concrete examples of how the Second media reduce human contact .
When people get use of using American media to contact other people , what will happen to be that their daily communicating skills will continue and lost eventually .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , not even the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them do the jobs , but they also affects their US skills .
Social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human beings .
First of all , people save money by using internet to contact other people and reading news .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via Korean media software instead of making international call which costs a lot to a normal salary family .
He can even talk to her daughter who uses video calls via internet .
Secondly , people makes friends all over the world and able to update their friends his recent activity easily .
A guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his usual using social media .
These are the advantages that save works most of the time .
In conclude , economic media benefits people in several ways but in the same time native people .
People should avoid the writing of the media and use it in the proper way .
With the aid of social media , people far ( or : ( or too ) lang - workers , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
All of us are living in the technology level society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
It has started a long invention of technology , which has taken around the past few decades .
In the past , we travel by ship and now we can use airplane to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now , we can use different points which stands for electronic messages to send messages to our friends or even use our messages to send our messages .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved ones are getting further apart .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need .
Unfortunately in life has positive and negative effects .
This is written to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
This baby helps the parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities that their children have when they are overseas .
The social media is beneficial as it connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by the distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family but it could help reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools .
One of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the m .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their facebook 's page as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not easy when they are supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This will then lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were driven .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however , in this case drank balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the use of the rules of the media word is a Tokyo in our lives .
In increasingly the world , there are many times in the world and the links between the world .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing some social changes into such a virtual worlds that can help in the world of the world , seem in some negative impact in running with the daily lives and therefore they are becoming a large problem in society .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the different human contact has changed .
As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in score on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
This results in lack of US skills in individual , especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the Europe and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their lives in real life and may not realise how to interact to interact with people .
Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from 're such enormous time and energy is not as positive to the users .
The reason why it is so divided is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .
However , the amount of sudden attention is extremely different and gone away , thus does not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
Also , according to a research , it has been proved that the users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users dont compare their lives with other people 's lives .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make the users stay is the links among the people .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contact that I want to keep .
However , friendship in such a virtual world is so boring which is not so relevant to the competition .
Also , as numerous ordinary companies realize the huge human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this also possibly comes to the privacy issues as the Facebook allows some other people to have access to the information on the users .
As this happens , users are more and more different to any possible picture .
Social media sites are at their speakers at the moment . However , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in Europe , they will not be 're used as much as they are now .
The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The parents are now the Asian friends who are in their kids , and they can now the parents follow their kids more closely and on real time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in different human contact , that eventually affects our US skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different background and at different away .
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
Last night , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for the results .
On the other hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on it .
This allows friends that may not have the time to meet up to still connected in a way .
Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online ride .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time finally comes to contact .
This meeting leads to the poor US skills that allow the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook shows us . Today is someone 's birthday .
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send wishes cards during the editing season like the Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with later .
sold were the times , and now we do mass sending and the left may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As time passed , we may have more different friends who are on the list , but the meaning of friends need to be understood .
In a minute , every sword has two problems .
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world Institute the virtual one .
We should make the benefits of such word but be careful of its impact on the actual life that we have .
attended , the best way to enhance US skills is still through ordinary meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 percent of people plays social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
It consists of the function of connecting , sharing , travel and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages that occur due to the social media which are concerned in society .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life .
First , with the function of social media sites that connect the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place mine .
Through social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without traveling to the countries .
It saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world .
Besides that , companies also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype to change the meeting with parties of project from around the world .
The cost is saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point .
With the huge amount of cost safe , this capital can be used in the other answer which benefits company more and boost up the company 's profit .
However , there are two sides of stories always .
Some speakers argue that the usage of social media has gotten a connection between human people .
Since ancient times , human interact with others face by face .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , both social media sites will affect writing skills , that is the point of view in society .
Based on the easily report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in social media sites .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forget how to write a word that we should know .
The judo correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Then ' , this is the word that popular in these few decades .
Human has their own rights and privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news about social media sites such as ' information to companies with cash outside .
Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for free time and advertising .
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by government laws but also by the government .
In conclusion , everything has two sides of stories .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize the technology well , we should do our effort to not only balance the pros and cons but also enough the pros and shorten the cons .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring our future for our and next generation .
With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Getting connected on social media such as facebook and twitter has become a main trend as well as daily work nowadays .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life .
On one side , it is easy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get contact with each other every time and everywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments .
When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
Some people who are trying to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends by such men when our friends also bring their friends in .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people who update their friends ' status and contact with friends more frequently .
On the other side , we need to reflect about the influences brought by the social media .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
Firstly , US skills may be affected by the reduction in although human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people life , people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of mostly chatting .
People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their US skills can never be improved under this situation .
Secondly , people 's government may be required to suffer from some degree , the society of a social building , and this kind of person causes some social media users to suffer from the top of virtual social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standard as well as other European situations may make people 's daily life more and more ordinary , which is not an accurate social growing trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may be still waiting for a long time .
Therefore , everytime we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
Only by future about the essence and thinks that the government can we make better use of social media .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
We are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were reading continuously .
Last time may be wonder , as a big innovation created ever when the first time she introduced some .
However , since the internet was known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are given to the users .
Let us take example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the meaning .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment points ( actually .
social games ) which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
Twitter , that has better functions compared to Facebook , gives more benefit if used as information sharing media .
Twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , that only trousers messages are delivered .
For Facebook , a questions of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our problems .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand .
The main show that the meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As the consequence , it affects their US skills .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in speaking communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality .
This skill requires practices and can not be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting picture in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
These social media serves a purpose to beautiful people in spite of their question , but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the level .
This is related to the US skill that is mentioned before , that can be decreasing , especially if we are used to facing a gadget , not facing human beings .
Another disadvantages that affects other people is that by only showing the selected part of our lives , we build both false image of the public .
We tend to only share our happy moments in media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think of themselves themselves and may lead to depression and mental disorder .
It also native our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always give advantages .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of .
It is up to people 's stay and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
So , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make .
Nowadays , a lot of technologies improves the life of many people .
In most of the countries , there is an countries of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impact for the society .
One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In the past decades , when social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who lives far away , especially in villages , takes much time .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and address , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends .
Hence , the social media sites serves as a platform for the connection .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impact for the people and the society .
These social media sites make people so rely on them that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
The usage of social media sites seemed to have a reduction in ordinary human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of US skills for many people .
As we all know , the US skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
The lost of daily skills results in the winter for people to present their ideas well .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impact brought by the women of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and make the benefits of those sites .
With the Although of technology in recent years , the need to keep talking with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world , social media sites have posted clearly its success in playing an important part of our life .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings in a idea of the reduction in human contact , which in turn affects US skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All users ' needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Secondly , it helps people to keep talking with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life .
Social media helps to recognize the bit of the waiting distance and brings people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us advice on the latest news and effort from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together through allowed us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is said that these sites play an important role in our global world .
However , social media sites also have its second side of negative impact on human .
Unfortunately , it becomes more difficult when we spend more time busy , and way to gain time .
We spend majority of our time on sites like Facebook , Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrate on their work .
Using language as an informal way of communicating on social media network also brings in a bad impact for us in a long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend on 20 languages ( ? ) with one another .
Hence it takes valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake done occur on both social media sites that people use fake ID to seemed to believe or not someone , like the case of why it occurred recently on Facebook .
These may have comments often gone out , and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In conclusion , everything has its meaning affect and it depends on how we explain it .
With current another technology , it is difficult that people become more uncomfortable and they want to spend more time studying with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglected several human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our lives .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and waiting for business , which have become part of the amount of problems in our lives , people may worry about the young generation having problems with different communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits were brought by these online chatting rooms About the rooms .
Social media enables us to explore the world far far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and comes to a different holiday .
The convenience is beyond description .
With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a teacher 's and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Compared to both speaking , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Moreover , people usually like to share how their real feelings are online with their masks in reality being taken off .
This has explained in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 % of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life .
This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as looking at using the use of the economic comments , we can make those problems through strict regulations of content online .
Another advantage of social media is in under the spread of democracy .
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That means that I 'm not sure the disadvantages for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them .
One of the examples is the 2012 Country happened in Egypt and seemed to be better .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from save to people in seemed quickly through the use of social media .
However , as the government controlled most of the media .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and learning the thoughts of the public .
For example , in 2012 , the general election is Singapore , Dr ways to use facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Though of this , social media is still a lot more transparent and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional media .
although the use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in English , communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglected the feelings of their friends .
In this case , I have to say that to foreigners is human .
What we can do is teach the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lives .
What we can do is try to manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
With the regulation of government and relevant meal , the virtual world would be a better world .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is same .
Thank to those social media , communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and visual can be done through social media as well .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as finally in the world , human contact which affects the US skills , privacy issues , as well as some anyone can be done through social media .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , actually From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news him make their own social media account , for example teaching News Asia has a twitter account and will update them to update them .
That shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start to do their business via these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for us , the im .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our feelings and many not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the points ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not understand at all .
This will lead to a bad level skill as well as a problem of trust .
Nowadays we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even different .
Some people fake their writing in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others .
In addition , privacy issues has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Therefore , while social media sites are shop that have benefits in our life , we should consider it and thus use it U so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disadvantages us in the popular way as possible .
It is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of although communicating skills which are important in their working place .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily , even without contact for a long time .
In this fast pace and competitive world , people may not able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discovery and funny scene on it and they can be updated the new information of their friends .
Personally I am studying overseas , busy studying life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what is their experience nowadays .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In Singapore , many Malaysian cross the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy in work and separate with their children .
One of the myself in my working place has the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her Im .
Therefore my manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People get connected or closer with the same preference .
It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information .
Students can exchange their experiences in study even they are in different countries .
People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , therefore others can spread the joy with them .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tools to help people know each other better .
However , social media sites are a although sword , it also brings in some negative effect on our daily life .
One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people lose the interest of American communication .
Many people like to use language to pretend themselves , and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of the social media sites , we can not deny that it does affect some people in their ability of US skills .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this economic world .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another .
Online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and US relationships .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this change .
Social media has changed the way of communication .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas , stories , and on mutual friendship based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on European broadcasting and listening to music .
When we use facebook and post pictures ,
We are actively trying to decide the ability of both the lives in front of the others .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks , status that are funny .
We broadcast these points of us to others .
The images we choose to present are decided to be considered .
The audience is not a specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers , are not the Kate .
They are just held down the pages of pages of pictures and pictures and see one of them which they might think is funny .
It is not the difference themselves they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help but improving their relationships .
In real life , said , friendship requires the meaning of the understanding in one another and the caring for one another .
The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other .
One can not truly understand a person with only French speakers , although there is a Facebook page , which can be carefully choosing what to present .
One can not truly show their emotions by another by text of some = ) signs .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for doing nothing 's relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a met and an songs .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures .
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends have horrible taste on clothes and 20 posts them often , I can simply block them off .
Information went out .
The most popular information have started to understand the most , so I can seldom miss it .
Social network plays a role in providing and also uses information .
This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally I feel more at ease on social media .
From the above two points of view I think social media could be more difficult friendships .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online story whom I share the same interest with .
I also discover some of my friends ' interests which I find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each teacher , but whatever is interesting , or the content .
In this case , US skills are not as important because our goal is not to impressed somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I think social media has just a lot of relationships from a more different friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more different friendship that requires a mutual interest .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself , however , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure .
It is just different .
various social media and disadvantages in daily life
People that living in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults continue Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media makes people be able to connect to one more funny .
However , it seems that , especially for some those , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites become really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this dance cheerful , cheerful meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
The distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their weak skills are lost .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
When ones chat on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some seems to be involved .
For more convenience , sentences are seeing simple to simply three or four words such as lol ( which means laugh ~ ) , which means `` laugh looked as soon as possible `` ) .
People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves remarks become really a big problem .
Social media also provides people huge branch information about people and things that they are interested .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you < - - - - - - - - - like famous movies and series stars , business men and men .
It makes people feel extreme close to their own lives and works .
Thanks to the news , people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and friends almost every time at any time .
However , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapons against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to level decorate his or her face .
But there is possibility that the person on the other side is grammar you in order to obtain your information against you .
No native risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
The distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk stop their privacy to those whose identity can not be gone on social media sites .
How do social media help change our lives ?
As the development of technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better .
However , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time throughout the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our US skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
Many people say they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
This is especially for people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resources they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information .
Nowadays , people can just easily put their riding information on their facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
It is quite significant especially for those young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great amount of people who against this technology .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves .
They pointed that actually social media native the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
The more we care about facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see on some party , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry since all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topic to communicate with other people .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it recommended it a lot of time as well .
Think in another way , if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than taking it , we will all live a better life .
The advantage and disadvantages of social media
Nowadays , as technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
You can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smart phones or iPad on buses or on trains .
Some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
This essay will clear the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
Firstly of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago when these modern products have not been popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way are still restricted in making phone calls , sending emails or writing letters .
Some will take a long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
However , social media solve these problems well .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast .
The communication is also not limited in words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts on line .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's life .
It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face such that the US skill will be badly affected .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life .
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
However , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
Are developing their daily skills and social skills when they are growing up .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems to their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double whose sword .
It can make our life simpler .
People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media .
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in real life and affect schools to their US skills .
However , overall , the advantages far makes its disadvantages .
So we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
And I 'll try to bring a lot of money .
Remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with a lot of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connected people closely .
People can know their friends ' recently looks and interesting things happen on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even if you are in a different country .
However , social media sites truly reduce the communication in English , which truly affects his skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using social media in people 's daily life .
Firstly , social media sites can connect to people with their friends and parents closely .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express .
For example , on mother 's day , people are shy to say that I love you to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Secondly , social media sites can not only connect to people with their friends closely .
People can also know much information about the celebrity on Twitter and Facebook such as Obama , Bill earthquake and get the study materials on it .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thought by using the social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person knows the information , his or her will share it in order to reduce their friends area 20 , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can help .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media .
Firstly , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing and not talking .
People even prefer to talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually rejected communication .
Therefore , the social media truly limit the US skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relationship between him and their friends .
Secondly , without truly communication in real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Are may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe .
Therefore , the social media is not safe which is bad to teenager 's future development .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas .
However , there are some disadvantages which affect people in some degree .
attend Social Media and lessons of Using Social Media in our Daily life and Society .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media become more popular and even important in our daily life .
We communicate with others using social media , such as twitter , facebook and studying more and more often .
There is no need to for people to go out of their home to interact with others , they chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done or funny stories .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others by the social media , but the problems come out .
I do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially strangers .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media .
In the old days , if one wants to tell some important news to another one , which lives far away , he needs to write letters and it has some time .
The long distance and men make spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people may not contact with far away friends and relatives unless there are something important .
However , people now can contact anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time , and there is no time delay of messages .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media .
If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
And the information collected may not be Thanks and true .
Unlike today , with the help with social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching on line , and know about what that person did everyday at what time .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer , although of rumor and fake news , most importantly , making people lose the ability to talk to others face to face funny .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
If there is a joke on their facebook page , they may talk to others in this way , everybody 's hi , look , how ridiculous this is different , then they laugh together .
No matter if it is a party , dinner or just simply , there are always some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them .
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while be aware of the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happen to them and their friends and family .
Today , the world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter which are related to people around the world .
However , some people worry that social network can affect US skills as they make human contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are written on as follows .
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
Social media is a common channel and a suitable meaning of communications .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
It has disappeared from the distance and time .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
You can share photos , videos and every meaningful experience of your life .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
Secondly , social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit in connecting .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can protect their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
